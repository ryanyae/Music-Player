# Music Player Project
## Being able to play music


### **TASK 2**

My project will be of a **music playing application**. Range of people will be able to use my application ranging 
music enthusiasts to those periodic listeners. In a perfect world this would be the place where you favourite 
artists will be able to release their new albums, singles, etc. But this application is not so much about the 
artists, but for the user and their overall experience. This project interests me because I have a big
passion for **software engineering** and just the realm of coding in general. I have done other personal projects, 
for now, only consists of fully functional websites hand typed by me :). I am hoping with this project that I am
able to expand my grasp on software engineering and make something other than a website.
