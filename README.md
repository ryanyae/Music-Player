# Airport Project
## Track people throughout the airport



### **TASK 2**
My project will be of an airport tracking application, **tracking passengers** throughout the
entire airport. It will simulate many scenarios how passengers can interact with different
checkpoints throughout the entire airport, checking in with their flights, if they've gone
through security yet, etc. People that will use this will be airports such as the **YVR**, **YYC**, etc.
This project is of interest as it will give experience in trying to create large scaled
projects and the fact that this system will be able to manage a bigger scale of data.


### **TASK 3**
* As a user I want to be able to check passengers in at the front desk, or at any
  checkpoint.
* As a user I want to abe to see which checkpoints people have been through which ever gate.
* As a user I want to be able to put some passengers to a priority seating list
* As a user I want to be able to book new passengers on the airplane
