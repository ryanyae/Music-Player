# Airport Tracking Project
## Track people throughout the airport





### **TASK 2**
My project will be of an airport tracking application, **tracking passengers** throughout the
entire airport. It will simulate many scenarios how passengers can interact with different
checkpoints throughout the entire airport, checking in with their flights, if they've gone
through security yet, etc. People that will use this will be airports such as the **YVR**, **YYC**, etc.
This project is of interest as it will give experience in trying to create big scaled
projects and the fact that this system will be able to manage a bigger scale of data and entries.


### **TASK 3**
* People can check in at the front desk
  * There will sections in the airport (international, domestic)
    * Some airports will be both domestic and international, or one or the other
      * Handle cases where people come to the wrong airport
* After they've checked in it will track in which checkpoints the person has gone through
* As a user I want to be able to block some people at certain checkpoints
* As a user I want to be able to certain passengers to a priority list
