# Airport Tracking Project

## tracking people throughout the airport

My project will be of an airport tracking application, **tracking passengers** throughout the
entire airport. It will simulate many scenarios how passengers can interact with different
check points throughout the entire airport, checking in with their flights, if they've gone
through security yet. People that will use this will be airports such as the **YVR**, **YYC**, etc.
This project will be of interest as it will give experience in trying to create big scaled
projects.

* People can check in at the front desk
  * There will sections in the airport (international, domestic)
    * Some airports will be both domestic and international, or one or the other
      * Handle cases where people come to the wrong airport
* After they've checked in it will track in which checkpoints the person has gone through
* As a user I want to be able to block some people at certain checkpoints
* As a user I want to be able to certain passengers to a priority list
